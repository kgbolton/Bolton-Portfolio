# Behind the Scenes of "The Best Political Consultant is Science"

### What political campaigning activities make the most difference? 
In my studies of Political Science and Electoral Politics in particular, I've come across a lot of research putting ideas about cause and effect in elections to the test - of rigourous academic methodology.
I've also volunteered for a number of campaigns and seen first hand how rarely the research is used to actually drive strategy. This project aims to illuminate that gap
and provide some guidance on strategies science has actually shown some efficacy for. 

### Outline
My audience is political strategists and the candidates themselves. 
- what are the most commonly used campaign strategies (mailers, social media and tv ads, phone banking, canvassing etc)
- how much do the most common ones influence voter opinion and/or likelihood to turn out (persuasion fails, but GOTV is possible with varying financial investment)
- innovative strategies have shown early promise in being effective at persuasion, but are not commonly used yet!
   - for example, nonvoters are largely ignored by campaigns, but a number of nonvoters would with some specific interventions
- call to action: use science-driven strategy to make a real difference in campaigns

### Data
Fortunately, researchers have already done the work of meta-analyzing the many individual studies that exist on persuasion and GOTV. I use data from the following papers:
KALLA, J. L., & BROOCKMAN, D. E. (2018). The minimal persuasive effects of campaign contact in general elections: Evidence from 49 field experiments. The American Political Science Review, 112(1), 148-166. doi:http://dx.doi.org.proxy.library.cmu.edu/10.1017/S0003055417000363

### Method and Medium
After collecting high level results from my studies, I create simple graphs in Tableau to get their message across. These are incorporated into a Shorthand story that also features graphics I created in diagrams.net

### Design and user research
The story is told based on my intuition of what would resonate with my hypothetical audience. No user research was conducted.

### Final story

I put this project together fairly quickly, and in being faced with time constraints I had to think critically about what the most important pieces of my story are. It could definitely benefit from further nuance and added context. Still, as it stands it gets across the big points I want my audience to walk away with. I aimed to make it as practically useful as possible; after all, their goal is simple: winning elections. If they come in wanting to know the cheapest way to get more votes, it won’t take them long to get that information. If they want to know whether they should invest in a huge social media ad buy, they’ll get some guidance on that decision – and if they’re skeptical of the data presented, they can review the source more thoroughly. 

One thing I learned during my effort to make academic research findings more accessible – it isn’t straightforward. The data I extracted are missing a lot of nuance discussed in the papers. Attempting to include all of it would have added a lot of clutter to my story. But without nuance, my visualizations may be overgeneralizing evidence and not giving a 100% accurate message. It’s a tradeoff, and I’m not sure I’m happy with where I’ve landed as of now. I hope to return to this project and further refine how I communicate this story. 

I found images and a video to use in my story from Upsplash and Coverr (royalty free stock footage). All graphics original.
