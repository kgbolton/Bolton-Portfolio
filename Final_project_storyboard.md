# Does Your Campaign Strategy Actually Work? 
# Evidence From the Literature

"Half the votes plus one." Everybody knows what it takes to win an election. But potential strategies to get there are infinite, and campaigns spend significant sums on strategic consultation.
Yet, another maxim in the world of political strategy is that it's okay to win using innovative tactics, but it's not okay to lose using them.
As such, despite consistent publication of new research, strategies implemented tend to be stagnant. 

### Most campaign tactics fall into the following buckets

### But recent research calls the entire persuasion bracket into question
Researchers at UC Berkely and Stanford conducted a meta-analysis of 40 field experiments and 9 original field experiments to measure the true effect of campaign contact and advertising. This graph shows the average of their data for general elections:

### GOTV holds more promise - but for how much?
Get the base to the polls. Sounds simple, but a lot of factors impede would-be voters from turning in their ballots (source). Many options exist to help them along, but most of them aren't cheap. Fortunately, seasoned political science researchers Donald Green and Alan Gerber have been synthesizing research on the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of different voter mobilization strategies since 2004 in their book ___Get Out The Vote___. Their most recent version, which incorporates the most recent cutting-edge research on voter mobiliziation, was published just last year. For the tactics that showed a statistically significant positive effect on turnout, they calculate an estimate of how much they end up costing per additional vote garnered:

### Is persuasion really impossible - or are the current methods just bad at it?
In the last few years, a strategy known as "Deep Canvassing" has gradually been subjected to the tests of scientific research. Earlier this year, a new paper conducted three experiments to separate and measure the effect of what is academically known as "non-judgmental exchange of narratives," whether they be in-person or by phone...
--- show the treatment effect as a big number ----
"Examining results on dichotomized versions of the individual items in the policy index, the average share of inclusive policies individuals strongly supported increased from 29% in the Placebo condition to 33% in the Full Intervention condition (p <0.01). For example, while the Abbreviated Intervention had no effect on individuals strongly supporting granting legal status to people who were brought to the US illegally as children and who have graduated from a U.S. high school, individuals assigned to the Full Intervention were __4.7 percentage points__ more likely to indicate strong support (p <0.04). Likewise, when dichotomizing the policy items by whether individuals supported each policy at all, instead of expressing indifference or opposition, the share of policies individuals supported at all increased by 2.2 percentage points in the Full Intervention condition (p= 0.058). Note again that all these estimates are intent-to-treat estimates and that the compliance-adjusted estimates would be larger."

Perhaps the traditional methods of persuasion are the real problem, not the idea of persuasion itself. In conclusion...

### Classic methods of persuasion just contribute to the noise of political theater. Campaigns are better off spending most of their dollars on turning out the base - with maybe a few to spare for high risk - and high promise - innovation.
