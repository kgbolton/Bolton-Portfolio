# Does Your Campaign Strategy Actually Work? 
# Evidence From the Literature

"Half the votes plus one." Everybody knows what it takes to win an election. But potential strategies to get there are infinite, and campaigns spend significant sums on strategic consultation.
Yet, another maxim in the world of political strategy is that it's okay to win using innovative tactics, but it's not okay to lose using them.
As such, despite consistent publication of new research, strategies implemented tend to be stagnant. 

### Most campaign tactics fall into the following buckets

### But recent research calls the entire persuasion bracket into question
Researchers at UC Berkely and Stanford conducted a meta-analysis of 40 field experiments and 9 original field experiments to measure the true effect of campaign contact and advertising. 
 We argue that the best estimate of the effects of campaign
contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero. First,
a systematic meta-analysis of 40 field experiments estimates an average effect of zero in general elections. Second, we present nine original field experiments that increase the statistical
evidence in the literature about the persuasive effects of personal contact 10-fold. These experiments’ average effect is also zero. In both existing and our original experiments, persuasive
effects only appear to emerge in two rare circumstances. First, when candidates take unusually unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable
voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects
immediately—although this early persuasion decays.

### GOTV holds more promise - but at what cost?



### Is persuasion really impossible - or are the current methods just bad at it?


### Classic methods of persuasion just contribute to the noise of political theater. Campaigns are better off spending most of their dollars on turning out the base - with maybe a few to spare on attempts at innovation.
