# Does Your Campaign Strategy Actually Work? 
# Evidence From the Literature

"Half the votes plus one." Everybody knows what it takes to win an election. But potential strategies to get there are infinite, and campaigns spend significant sums on strategic consultation.
Yet, another maxim in the world of political strategy is that it's okay to win using innovative tactics, but it's not okay to lose using them.
As such, despite consistent publication of new research, strategies implemented tend to be stagnant.

Researchers at UC Berkely and Stanford conducted a meta-analysis of 40 field experiments and 9 original field experiments to measure the true effect of campaign contact and advertising. This graph shows the average of their data for general elections:

### GOTV holds more promise - but at what cost?



### Is persuasion really impossible - or are the current methods just bad at it?


### Classic methods of persuasion just contribute to the noise of political theater. Campaigns are better off spending most of their dollars on turning out the base - with maybe a few to spare on attempts at innovation.
