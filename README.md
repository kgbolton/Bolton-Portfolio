# About me
My name is Katie Bolton, and I recently received a Master's degree in Data Analytics, Public Policy and Management from CMU Heinz College. I love thinking about society's problems and how I can help address them through my career and activities. I also love cooking for friends and living as sustainably as possible; there are at least 3 things fermenting at any given moment in my house!

The purpose of this page is to showcase some examples of my work. Most are from coursework projects at Heinz, but a couple are previous client products. The breadth of my education allowed me to attain some fundamental understanding across a wide variety of tools and methods. I am excited to build my expertise in a more focused domain.  

# Projects
Frequent goals: to communicate complex ideas in an accessible way, and to represent data in a way that is both accurate and persuasive. Emphasis on using sound methods and reproducability.
