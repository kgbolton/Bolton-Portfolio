# About me
My name is Katie Bolton, and I'm a CMU Heinz College Master's student studying Data Analytics, Public Policy and Management. I love thinking about society's problems and how I can help address them through my career and activities. I also love cooking for my friends and living as sustainably as possible. Efficiency itself has become a passion due to having so many things I want to be learning and working on. The purpose of this page is to showcase some examples of my work. They all come from projects required by my coursework at Heinz, which means that they are representative of my output for a role that would involve completing about 4-5 projects per month. I hope to continue building my proficiencies in my first Data Science role at a slightly slower pace. 

# Projects
I strive to communicate complex ideas in a highly accesible way, and to represent data in a way that is both accurate and persuasive. Emphasis on using sound methods and reproducability.
