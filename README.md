# About me
My name is Katie Bolton, and I'm a CMU Heinz College Master's student studying Data Analytics, Public Policy and Management. I love thinking about society's problems and how I can help address them through my career and activities. I also love cooking for friends and living as sustainably as possible; there are at least 3 things fermenting at any given moment in my house. There never seems to be enough time in a day... So I'm always interested in efficiency ideas too.

The purpose of this page is to showcase some examples of my work. They all come from my coursework projects at Heinz, which means that they are representative of my output for a role that involves 4-5 simultaneous obligations (not including ferments) and month-long project windows. In all seriousness, I'm not quite satisfied with any of these, but the breadth of my education has allowed me to attain some fundamental understanding across a wide variety of tools and methods. I am excited to expand my proficiences in a more focused domain. 

# Projects
Frequent goals: to communicate complex ideas in an accessible way, and to represent data in a way that is both accurate and persuasive. Emphasis on using sound methods and reproducability.
