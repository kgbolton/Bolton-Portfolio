# About me
My name is Katie Bolton, and I'm a CMU Heinz College Master's student studying Data Analytics. I love thinking about society's problems and how I can help address them through my career and activities. I also love cooking for my friends and living as sustainably as possible. I always feel like there's not enough time in a day because there's so many things I want to do, and there's always a million ways I could get better at all the things I'm already kinda good at. At the same time, I try to stay present and practice gratitude, making time for certain joys every day: tea in the morning, cooking a nourishing dinner, quality time with my partner and friends. Luckily they often overlap :)

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to communicate complex ideas in a highly accesible way. I also want to get better at communicating data in a way that is both accurate and persuasive.
