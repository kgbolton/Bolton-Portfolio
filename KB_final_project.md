# What political campaigning activities make the most difference? 

Lots of people have opinions about cause and effect in electoral politics. 
Lots of research has been published putting those claims to the test. So, what actually moves the needle?

# Outline
My audience is political strategists. 
- what are the most commonly used campaign strategies (mailers, social media and tv ads, phone banking, canvassing)
- how much do the most common ones influence voter opinion and/or likelihood to turn out (surprise, they mostly suck)
- here are some strategies that have been showed to be very effective, but are not commonly used yet!
   - for example, nonvoters are largely ignored by campaigns, but a number of nonvoters would with some specific interventions
- call to action: use more of the effective stuff

# Data
various research papers available through CMU databases 

# Method and Medium
I have to do the legwork of collecting data from a bunch of different research papers for this story, but due to previous Political Science coursework I've taken 
I have a good idea of what I need to search already. I will use Shorthand to tell the story.
Sorry I don't have more to show for all this, I'm super overwhelmed by my workload this mini. BUT I truly appreciate this class and wish more classes at Heinz were like this.  
If I wasn't worried about failing my classes I would be spending way more of my energy on this lol. I plan to fix up my portfolio over winter break. 
Let me know if I become at risk of failing this class. I'm really trying to not fail anything!!
