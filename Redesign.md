# This page critques a published visualization and redesigns it
Public opinion polls are abundant. Drawing conclusions from them isn't always straightforward.  [This article](https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/)
is discussing a shift in support for it caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. I chose it since I’m going to be covering Medicare-for-All in my final project, and I wanted to start thinking critically about the info
that's already out there. I thought the second graphic was the worse of the two, so I chose to redesign that one. 

## Critique and brainstorming
When I first looked at the stacked bar chart, it was intimidating. A lot of bars and a lot of sections in each one. One thing that helped and that I thought worked well is the title, which clearly states the takeaway that is most relevant to the argument the article is making, and accurately conveys the data. However, I wasn’t sure why they included the ACA. It seems tangential to the article topic, and doubles the number of bars on the graphic. I have to think very critically to draw insights from its presents, so I think I wouldn’t present all the ACA data… Maybe just a note that results were similar for the ACA. I’m also not a fan of the green-yellow-red color scheme for this data, because it seems to imply a normative connotation for increasing support for those policies (supporting is good, opposing is bad). Plus, I think the “Makes no difference” and “Don’t Know/No opinion” middle pieces are mostly just distracting from the relevant data, so I ended up not wanting to include them in the graphic at all. 
Upon closer look at the full dataset that this article drew from, I decided to contextualize the COVID-19 question on universal healthcare with a completely different poll question.
## Wireframe feedback

I asked my partner and a friend to give me feedback on my approach to this data. My partner is colorblind so his first thought was that he couldn't distinguish two of the colors, commenting that it was "super ableist."
Mildly inconvenient since purple is a natural choice of a group that is composed of the blue and red groups, but I changed it to a dark forest green and the message still gets
across. He also reccomended making the bar graphs properly scaled, which I did in the final version.
Another influential piece of feedback came from my friend:
"Why do we need both graphs in the left table that say support vs. oppose? Shouldn't the support vs. oppose graphs on the left table be perfect inverses of each other, and if not, then is the remaining percentage people who didn't answer or are undecided? Same for the table on the right, the three Republican stances for example don't add up to 100% -- I always get thrown off by that on a graph. It also looks like Republicans are generally less likely to support ACA now so support has gone down within their party line."
I originally got rid of the undecided field in order to reduce the business of the graphic, but after that comment, I decided to make a note about them to avoid future confusion.
