# This page explores the government debt of a selection of countries
Specifically, I look at an OECD dataset on debt-to-GDP ratios. From the [source](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm):
"General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits."

Based on that last sentence, we can interpret sudden significant changes in this ratio as an indication of how deficit spending changed in the year preceding. In the first graphic, we look at a snapshot in time, and can see how vastly different the financial position of the selected countries is. In the second graphic, we begin to get a better sense of how their position has changed over time. It seems that many countries have stayed relatively stable or slowly increased their ration since 1995, though a few have seen drastic changes. How did the 2008 financial crisis impact this ratio around the world? In the last graphic, the years of 2006 - 2010 are focused on. Look at countries of interest to see how they were affected. It looks like many countries had to increase deficit spending to keep their people (and markets) afloat.
